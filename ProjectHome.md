minRXOSD is the firmware for an OSD which shows CRC checked good/bad packet information of the well known and very well working Scherrer UHF LRS: http://www.tslrs.com/

minRXOSD uses a cheap hardware known as MinimOSD (about 18$) and can be used standalone or in conjunction with another OSD like, in this example, the minOPOSD: http://code.google.com/p/minoposd/

It's based on the ArduCamOSD project: http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/

This project is GNU GPL v3 and using it is at your own risk.

The newest version is using the live channel bads info from the LRS RX with firmware V2.7.

The advantage of using CRC checked live channel bads is that you see bad packets directly when they occur and that is earlier than an analog RSSI will show you that the radio link gets weak!

Here is the boot screen with the info from the LRS RX:

The lowest two lines are from the minOPOSD which displays all the OpenPilot flight data.

Here you can see the first bad packets.

In the blue rectangle there is the bad packets warning.

In the green rectangle you see the disturbed channels (only one channel in this situation, maybe a device from the building site?)

In the red rectangle you see the failsafe count (currently zero), the packet count with CRC errors, the over all packet count and the percentage of good/bad packets of the last 4.5 seconds calculated out of the B:x and G:y data.

All other data is processed by the minOPOSD firmware on a second MinimOSD hardware.

Some minutes later at the same place some more bad packets.

There are 2 bad packets since the current warning and over all 12 bad packets on the same channel:

Watch the whole flight here:

(bad packets at 06:42 and 09:24, and a test at the end of the flight)

The following screenshot shows an example of the very first beta version with an older firmware of the LRS RX.

The data in the red rectangle is processed by the minRXOSD firmware on one MinimOSD hardware.

It shows the over all bad packets count of the LRS RX and the disturbed channels with the count of bad packets of any channel.

All other data is processed by the minOPOSD firmware on a second MinimOSD hardware.

The bad packets count normally is not that high!

It's just generated for testing purpose by removing the antenna and using the LRS TX in low power mode.

In a normal flight the bad packets count is about 0 to a few per minute, but when it starts rising you know that you are reaching the limits (or some equipment in your plane/copter disturbes the system? do a clean build!) and you have to turn around or power up the LRS TX.

Here is a video of a flight showing few bad packets while flying low, lower than the recommended 1/10 height, rather 1/100 sometimes.

They occur at e.g. 00:43, 01:59, 02:58 and so on...

This proves the minRXOSD system working.

The following video shows the final stage of one of the first testflights.

The flight was with 0 bad packet, ok it wasn't that far away and that low...

Only while landing beneath the metal construction (Faraday knows why ;-) there was 1 bad packet (at 00:31), also proving the minRXOSD system is working.

After the flight some testing follows (starting at 02:20) with removed antenna and using low power.

The messages 'BATT LOW', 'DISARMED', 'FAILSAFE' and 'RSSI LOW' are generated by the other OSD system with minOPOSD firmware.
