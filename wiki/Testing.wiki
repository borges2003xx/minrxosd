= How to test =


After you soldered, compiled, flashed, loaded, configured, connected and DOUBLE-CHECKED everything you can power the system and test it.

Just switch the LRS TX in low power mode and disconnect the TX antenna and walk away some meters.

Now you should see the bad packet infos in the OSD.
